# OrthoID
OrthoID aims to test your knowledge in identifying different species of orthopteran insects (like crickets and grasshoppers) based on their calls! 

Included is a reference guide for species in Eastern Texas with recordings, pictures, and distribution maps. The framework of OrthoID is developed for easy adaptability to other focal groups of vocalizing insects for which users have available recordings - the recordings used in this app were collected from the Singing Insects of North America (SINA) online database.
